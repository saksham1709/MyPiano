It is a virtual piano using pure javascript and could be played using both keyboard and mouse and is currently not a responsive website , i.e , only for desktop. Pardon me for notes if they are not with their respective keys or even if they are not notes , i don't have much knowledge about music or piano so , all these notes used are because of random internet search. I will keep on updating this piano and try to make it as good as possible.
